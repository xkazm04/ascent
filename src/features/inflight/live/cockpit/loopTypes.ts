// The cockpit's WIRE shapes — what the three loop routes actually hand a browser.
//
// The run/lane/detail records are re-exported straight from the server's own type module
// (`@/lib/db/loop-runs-types`) rather than restated here: a second, "equivalent" client copy is the
// classic way a field silently stops arriving. The import is type-only, so nothing server-side is
// pulled into the bundle.
//
// `LoopProposal` and `LoopStatusPayload` are the two shapes that exist ONLY as route responses (the
// propose route composes the first; the GET status route composes the second), so they are declared
// here — the routes' own declarations live next to `export const runtime`, which a client module has
// no business importing from.

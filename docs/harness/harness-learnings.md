## Structural facts
- **2026-06-02** — Scan cache keys by the **commit** sha (`resolveHead`, `application/vnd.github.sha`),
  but `fetchSnapshot` historically stamped `repoMeta.headSha = treeRes.sha` — the **tree object's** sha,
  not the commit's. Latent mismatch between the cache/persistence key and the report's recorded headSha.
  Now aligned via `ScanOptions.headSha` (scan.ts) which stamps the resolved commit sha.
- **2026-06-02** — Head-sha resolution has two flavors: **conditional + hint** (free 304s via
  `headHintGet/Set` + `If-None-Match`) in `lookupCachedScan` and `resolveHeadWithHint` (scan-cache.ts),
  vs. the old **unconditional** `resolveHeadSha` (removed — it burned a rate-limit unit per call).
- **2026-06-02** — Overall score roll-up is a **renormalized archetype-weighted mean**, single-sourced
  in `overallScoreFor` (maturity/model.ts) and used by both the engine and the MockProvider.
- **2026-06-02** — In-memory scan cache (cache.ts) is the **primary** cache tier: key
  `owner/repo@sha::{llm|mock}`, 15-min TTL. The DB tier is opt-in (`DATABASE_URL`); the MVP runs DB-less.
- **2026-06-02** — LLM-failure fallback: scan.ts degrades to `MockProvider`; `report.engine.provider==='mock'`
  while the scan requested LLM is the signal that the model didn't contribute (and the `::llm` cache must NOT store it).

## Conventions enforced
- **2026-06-02** — One canonical cache key everywhere via `makeCacheKey` (cache.ts); every reader/writer
  (scan routes, badge, gate) must resolve the sha through a `resolveHead`-based path so keys agree.
- **2026-06-02** — Signal extraction must stay a pure function of the snapshot: detectors take an injected
  `nowMs` (no `Date.now()` inside), so a snapshot re-scored later yields identical scores.
- **2026-06-02** — AI/bot commit attribution is single-sourced as `isAiCommit` (analyze/index.ts); don't
  re-inline the `AI_TRAILER` / `[bot]` regex.

## Anti-patterns to avoid
- **2026-06-02** — `clamp(Math.round(Number(x))) || 0` silently turns a missing/NaN value into a real 0.
  Use `Number.isFinite` to distinguish "absent" from "genuinely 0" (cost: it defeated the LLM coverage gate).
- **2026-06-02** — Parsing GitHub timestamps with `new Date(x).getTime()` and no NaN guard poisons medians
  (`NaN` sorts unstably, serializes as `null`). Guard at the boundary; filter non-finite before aggregating.
- **2026-06-02** — Two hand-rolled mappers over the same REST response drift. Normalize once (`mapGhRepo`).

## Open follow-ups (from Pipeline C scan-and-decide, 2026-06-02)
- **Degraded-mock persistence**: the `#2` fix only skips the in-memory `cacheSet`. When `DATABASE_URL`
  is set, `persistScanReport` still persists a degraded-mock report and `getScanReportByCommit` (tier-2)
  could serve it on a later scan. Future: guard persistence of `engine.provider==='mock'` when LLM was
  requested, or down-key it. (Persistence group — out of scope for the Repository Scanning & Scoring run.)
- **headSha stamping for PR-ref scans**: `report.repo.headSha` is stamped to the resolved commit sha only
  for anonymous cached scans (`ScanOptions.headSha`). PR-gating (`ref`) scans still record `treeRes.sha`.
  Consider always recording the commit sha so report/persistence identity is uniform.

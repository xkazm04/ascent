## Structural facts
- **2026-06-02** — Scan cache keys by the **commit** sha (`resolveHead`, `application/vnd.github.sha`),
  but `fetchSnapshot` historically stamped `repoMeta.headSha = treeRes.sha` — the **tree object's** sha,
  not the commit's. Latent mismatch between the cache/persistence key and the report's recorded headSha.
  Now aligned via `ScanOptions.headSha` (scan.ts) which stamps the resolved commit sha.
- **2026-06-02** — Head-sha resolution has two flavors: **conditional + hint** (free 304s via
  `headHintGet/Set` + `If-None-Match`) in `lookupCachedScan` and `resolveHeadWithHint` (scan-cache.ts),
  vs. the old **unconditional** `resolveHeadSha` (removed — it burned a rate-limit unit per call).
- **2026-06-02** — Overall score roll-up is a **renormalized archetype-weighted mean**, single-sourced
  in `overallScoreFor` (maturity/model.ts) and used by both the engine and the MockProvider.
- **2026-06-02** — In-memory scan cache (cache.ts) is the **primary** cache tier: key
  `owner/repo@sha::{llm|mock}`, 15-min TTL. The DB tier is opt-in (`DATABASE_URL`); the MVP runs DB-less.
- **2026-06-02** — LLM-failure fallback: scan.ts degrades to `MockProvider`; `report.engine.provider==='mock'`
  while the scan requested LLM is the signal that the model didn't contribute (and the `::llm` cache must NOT store it).
- **2026-06-03** — `relationMode="prisma"` (schema.prisma) ⇒ **no DB foreign keys**: orphaning is silent (no
  error), so process-local id caches (e.g. `orgIdCache` in scans.ts) must re-verify or invalidate, not trust forever.
- **2026-06-03** — Prisma maps `DateTime` to a UTC `timestamp` (no `@db` override on `Scan.scannedAt`), so
  `date_trunc('day', "scannedAt")` yields the **UTC** day — matches the `toISOString().slice(0,10)` axis keys (usage.ts).
- **2026-06-03** — `persistScanReport` (scans.ts) now evicts the in-memory scan cache (`cacheDelete`) after a
  fresh non-deduped write, so a `fresh=1` re-test of an unchanged commit isn't shadowed by the prior report.
- **2026-06-03** — `GET /api/scan?peek=1` is a **cache-only** probe (returns cached/persisted report or 204, never
  scans); the `/report?repo=` client peeks it before opening the SSE stream so an unchanged head hydrates instantly.

## Conventions enforced
- **2026-06-02** — One canonical cache key everywhere via `makeCacheKey` (cache.ts); every reader/writer
  (scan routes, badge, gate) must resolve the sha through a `resolveHead`-based path so keys agree.
- **2026-06-02** — Signal extraction must stay a pure function of the snapshot: detectors take an injected
  `nowMs` (no `Date.now()` inside), so a snapshot re-scored later yields identical scores.
- **2026-06-02** — AI/bot commit attribution is single-sourced as `isAiCommit` (analyze/index.ts); don't
  re-inline the `AI_TRAILER` / `[bot]` regex.
- **2026-06-03** — SVG chart scale math is single-sourced in `chartScale.ts` (`vScale`/`xScale` + `LEVEL_BANDS`/
  `BAND_EDGES`); TrendChart, Sparkline, DimLine route through it — don't re-inline the 0..100 y-scale per chart.
- **2026-06-03** — Centered empty/notice states go through `components/EmptyState.tsx` (icon, title, body,
  actions[]); don't hand-roll the markup (the report/trends/usage variants had drifted on tokens + icon size).

## Anti-patterns to avoid
- **2026-06-02** — `clamp(Math.round(Number(x))) || 0` silently turns a missing/NaN value into a real 0.
  Use `Number.isFinite` to distinguish "absent" from "genuinely 0" (cost: it defeated the LLM coverage gate).
- **2026-06-02** — Parsing GitHub timestamps with `new Date(x).getTime()` and no NaN guard poisons medians
  (`NaN` sorts unstably, serializes as `null`). Guard at the boundary; filter non-finite before aggregating.
- **2026-06-02** — Two hand-rolled mappers over the same REST response drift. Normalize once (`mapGhRepo`).
- **2026-06-03** — A catch-all `catch { negSet() }` that negative-caches on ANY error pins valid repos to a
  failure for the whole TTL on a transient blip. Only cache GENUINE not-found (typed `GitHubError` code); serve
  a neutral result without poisoning on transient/5xx (badge route).
- **2026-06-03** — Building a day-bucketed chart axis from a LOCAL `new Date()` while keying buckets by UTC date
  drops near-midnight-UTC rows into the idx-miss gap. Anchor axis + window to the same UTC-day floor (usage.ts).

## Open follow-ups (from Pipeline C scan-and-decide, 2026-06-02)
- **Degraded-mock persistence**: the `#2` fix only skips the in-memory `cacheSet`. When `DATABASE_URL`
  is set, `persistScanReport` still persists a degraded-mock report and `getScanReportByCommit` (tier-2)
  could serve it on a later scan. Future: guard persistence of `engine.provider==='mock'` when LLM was
  requested, or down-key it. (Persistence group — out of scope for the Repository Scanning & Scoring run.)
- **headSha stamping for PR-ref scans**: `report.repo.headSha` is stamped to the resolved commit sha only
  for anonymous cached scans (`ScanOptions.headSha`). PR-gating (`ref`) scans still record `treeRes.sha`.
  Consider always recording the commit sha so report/persistence identity is uniform.

## Open follow-ups (from Pipeline C scan-and-decide, 2026-06-03 — "Reporting, Persistence & Metering" group)
- **D5 client lazy-load (the user-visible half)**: `getRepositoryHistory({includeDimensions:false})` and
  `/api/history?dims=0` ship the lightweight overall-only query, but NO consumer uses it yet — both the
  `/trends` page (`DimensionTrends`) and `ReportView`'s history fetch still pull per-dimension data on first
  paint. To realize the "first paint skips dimension rows" win, fetch light server-side for the overall chart
  and lazy-load the by-dimension grid client-side (in-view) via `?dims=0`→full. Deferred: it rearchitects the
  trends page's primary content and needs an app-run to verify. Idea `efdf1427` left **accepted** (not implemented).
- **`scans.ts` commit hygiene**: the B4/B5/D3 commit (`2f15b37`) bundles substantial pre-existing working-tree
  WIP in `scans.ts` (~600 lines that predate this run), per an explicit user decision. If you bisect, that
  commit is not a clean single-concern change.
- **D1 raw-SQL portability**: `fetchDailySeries` (usage.ts) uses `date_trunc`/`to_char` via `$queryRaw` with a
  JS row-bucketing fallback in `catch`. Verify the aggregation against a real Postgres/Aurora-DSQL instance —
  the no-DB dev path can't confirm the day buckets match the JS fallback exactly at tz boundaries.
